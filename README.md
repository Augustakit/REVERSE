# Description
1.This mod adds a reverse perspective to all vehicles, and modifies the third-person perspective of some vehicles, and adds a crosshair to some vehicles.

2.`ReverseChaseCam` is to switch viewpoints by clicking the right mouse button, and `PlaneUniqueCamera` is to switch viewpoints by pressing the C or X keys.

3.Modify it inside the config folder. It is recommended to modify only `REVERSED_TRANSFORM`, `CAMERA_TRANSFORM`, `TARGET_OFFSET`, `WANT_DISTANCE`, `GunnerCAMERA_TRANSFORM`, `GunnerTARGET_OFFSET`.

4.This mod may conflict with vehicle modifications, mod URL: https://community.veniceunleashed.net/t/vehicle-modifications-fov-camera-position-disable-threshold/3385

5.Finally, I would like to thank Mr Janssent for his technical guidance and support, I was able to complete this mod under Janssent. Mr Janssent's Github page: https://github.com/J4nssent
